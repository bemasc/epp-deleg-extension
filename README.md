A small group of DNS engineers is currently working on a document
entitled "Extensible Delegation for DNS" ([\[DELEG\]](https://github.com/fl1ger/deleg)), which aims to
provide an enhanced method of delegation in the DNS, as an alternative
to the traditional NS record.

This proposal has the potential to address many long-standing issues
affecting the DNS. While it has yet to be brought to the IETF in a
formal submission, it has generated significant interest.

Past experience with innovations in the DNS suggests that the success or
failure of a new technology can depend on how quickly the provisioning
side of the domain name industry moves to support the new technology.

Therefore, this document has been created to describe an extension to
the EPP domain mapping ([RFC5731](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5731)) to allow EPP clients to provision DELEG
records for domain names in an EPP server.
